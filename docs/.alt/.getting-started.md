## Getting Started

Alternator works by reading the files in your `<source>` directory, filling in
the layouts, includes, and variables, then saving the rendered files to
your `<target>` directory for publishing.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target
```

Layouts, includes, and variables are defined in text-based `<source>` files
using comments and metadata. More on that later.

### Watching for Changes

Use the `--watch` flag to monitor `<source>` for changes and automatically
render after each save.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target --watch
[watch] watching path/to/source for changes
^c to stop
```

### Localhost Server

Use the `--port` option to serve `<target>` on a localhost server.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target --port 8080
[serve] serving path/to/target at http://localhost:8080
^c to stop
```

### Putting It Together

`--watch` and `--port` can be combined for a simple dev setup.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target -wp 8080
[watch] watching path/to/source for changes
[serve] serving path/to/target at http://localhost:8080
^c to stop
```
