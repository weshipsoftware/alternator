## Getting Started

Alternator reads the files in your `<source>` directory, fills in the layouts,
includes, and variables, then saves the rendered files to your `<target>`
directory for publishing.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target
```

Layouts, includes, and variables are defined in `<source>` files using comments
and metadata. More on that later.

### Watching for Changes

Use the `--watch` flag to monitor `<source>` for changes and automatically
render after each save.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target --watch
[watch] watching path/to/source for changes
^c to stop
```

### Localhost Server

Add a `--port` to serve `<target>` on a localhost server.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target --port 8080
[serve] serving path/to/target at http://localhost:8080
^c to stop
```

### Putting It Together

Combine `--watch` and `--port` for a simple dev setup.

```shell
/website $ alternator path/to/source path/to/target -wp 8080
[watch] watching path/to/source for changes
[serve] serving path/to/target at http://localhost:8080
^c to stop
```
